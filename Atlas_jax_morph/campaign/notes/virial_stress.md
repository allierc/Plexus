# virial_stress (VirialStress)

Read `physics/mechanics/stress.py` (the whole 58-line module, one class), its base
`core/step.py:SimulationStep` (the quasistatic contract, `state.set`), and the real math it
delegates to: `PairwisePotential.virial_pressure` in `physics/mechanics/potentials.py`, plus the
`neighbor_sum` / `safe_norm` / `safe_divide` helpers in `core/geometry.py` and `core/ad_utils.py`.
Cross-read the paper's Methods "Mechanical Stress" paragraph (p. 16) and the main-text usage
(p. 7-8 "Mechanical Control of Cell Proliferation", Fig. 4 / S6).

`VirialStress` itself is a thin quasistatic sensing step: `state.set('stress',
potential.virial_pressure(state))`. It writes a transient per-cell `stress` field
(`heritable=False`), moves nothing, and carries no numeric knob -- its only field is the
`potential`, and the whole point is that a traced potential param (e.g. `epsilon`) stays
optimizable *through* the written stress.

**The surprise (headline).** SOURCE != PAPER. The code computes the textbook Irving-Kirkwood
virial pressure: `p_i = -(1/(2 d V_i)) sum_j r_ij (dU/dr)`, radial projection, normalized by the
cell's own d-ball volume and dimension, with a 1/2 bond split and a minus sign so compression is
positive. The paper (p. 16) instead defines `sigma_i = sum_j [F_ij,x*sgn(dx) + F_ij,y*sgn(dy)]`
-- a *component-wise sign* (taxicab) weighting, no volume/dimension normalization, no 1/2 split,
2D-only. These are genuinely different quantities (differently weighted, and off by ~2 d V_i per
cell). Per the loop rule I recorded the code's form as authoritative and the contradiction in
`surprises:`. Other easy-to-miss details: dU/dr is autodiff of the *cutoff-multiplied* energy;
`safe_norm`/`safe_divide` keep the r=0 diagonal and V_i=0 dead slots finite under debug_nans;
`neighbor_sum` masks self- and dead-pairs; no in-library step *reads* `stress` (its consumer is a
gene-network input in the examples).

**Did NOT establish:** whether this hardened reimplementation's `virial_pressure` reproduces the
*original* jax-morph numeric stress trajectory. I confirmed the FORM disagrees with the paper text
but did not run the oracle to diff a reference stress signal -- that is a validation-stage
question, and I flagged it rather than assuming equivalence. I also did not trace exactly which
example notebook's gene-input node consumes `stress`, only that nothing inside the package does.
