# harmonic (Harmonic pair potential @ potentials.py:L375)

**What I read.** The whole `Harmonic` class (L375-416) and everything it inherits: `PairwisePotential`
(L128-266, giving `total_energy` = 0.5*sum over live non-self pairs, `forces = -jax.grad(energy)`,
`virial_pressure`, and the scalar-or-per-cell-field coupling resolution + arithmetic-mean `mix`) and the
`Potential` protocol (L56). Compared it against its four siblings in the same file to see what Harmonic
does DIFFERENTLY.

**What it does to the state.** Nothing directly — a Potential is a pure energy/force function. `pair_energy`
is a parabola in `(r - sigma)`, `sigma = r_i + r_j` (contact = sum of radii), shifted down by
`(r_c - sigma)^2` and hard-truncated to 0 at `r_c = r_cutoff_frac*sigma` (default 2.5). The shift puts the
well minimum below zero at contact, so it is repulsive when compressed and **adhesive** when stretched
(`sigma < r < r_c`). Params: `k` (stiffness) and `r_cutoff_frac` (range). Forces are consumed by the
wrapping relaxation/Brownian step, which is what moves positions.

**Line/anchor checks.** L375 is exactly `class Harmonic(PairwisePotential)` — code_path unchanged. Paper
anchor: p. 9 ("Mechanical interactions", eq. Vij) and SI p. 14 — but see the surprise.

**What surprised me.** (1) BIGGEST: Harmonic is **not in the paper at all**. The paper defines a single
mechanical potential, the Morse well; Harmonic, SoftSphere, Hertzian and LennardJones are library-only
additions. The source is strictly richer than the paper here — no contradiction, but a paper-only
reimplementer would never write this class. (2) The down-shift is load-bearing: drop `(r_c - sigma)^2` and
you get a purely repulsive, infinite-range spring with no adhesion and no truncation — the opposite of the
intended finite-range well. (3) C0-only cutoff — unlike Morse/LJ (C1 `_smooth_cutoff`) and
SoftSphere/Hertzian (compact C1 tail), Harmonic uses a bare `jnp.where`, so the FORCE jumps at `r_c`; the
docstring calls it harmless because `r_c` sits far beyond resting contact. (4) Two combining rules coexist:
`sigma` additive (`r_i+r_j`), coupling `k` arithmetic-mean `mix` (deliberately not Lorentz-Berthelot — no
sqrt, keeps the gradient NaN-safe).

**What I did NOT establish.** I did not run the oracle — no numeric confirmation of the energy/force
(evidence left null; EXCAVATOR pass). I did not find any campaign config or paper experiment that actually
drives Harmonic (everything uses Morse), so whether this class is exercised downstream is unconfirmed —
`k`-as-a-per-cell-`StateFieldSpec` is a supported mode but I saw no caller use it. `virial_pressure` is
inherited/available but I did not trace whether any step consumes it for Harmonic. Left `verdict`/`contract`
for the normalizer per the role rules.
