## Death (physics/death.py:L26) -- inspected

Read the whole `Death` class, its `StochasticStep` base (`core/step.py`), the AD primitives it
calls (`sample_bernoulli_st`, `bernoulli_logp` in `core/ad_utils.py`), and the sibling `Division`
it must compose with. It is Division's mirror image: a per-cell Bernoulli hazard
`p = 1 - exp(-death_rate*dt)`, forward-exact with an identity straight-through surrogate, replayed
HARD (flip `alive`, write a float `death` record) and scored by a masked score-function `logp`.

**Biggest surprise -- a code-vs-paper contradiction, and it runs the other direction from the usual
one.** The paper has NO death mechanism at all: "death"/"apoptosis"/"necrosis" occur ZERO times
(grep of the extracted text). The forward model's capability list (p. 2) is exactly "division,
growth, mechanical stress sensing, and morphogen excretion and detection." The paper's only cell
removal is an *external* robustness ablation -- deleting a random fraction of an already-finished
cluster to measure loss sensitivity (p. 8; Fig. caption p. 21), not a dynamic step. So `Death` is a
library step the source ships but the paper never describes. Recorded per rule 5 (source wins).

**Other traps I flagged:** `died` (ephemeral scored trace) vs `death` (persistent float record,
re-derived in replay by `(died>0.5) & alive`, and OVERWRITTEN not accumulated each step); the
Division-before-Death ordering and deferred slot reuse that keep `reconstruct_lineage` correct; the
`death_rate` clip to >=0 that stops a negative rate NaN-ing `bernoulli_logp`; and that the tunable
hazard is a STATE field, not a constructor arg (the only ctor param is `score_by_default`).

**Did NOT establish:** I did not run the oracle (paper ships no death config, and jax is
deliberately absent from this env), so I have no numerical trajectory confirming the hazard/lineage
behaviour -- purely a source read. I also did not trace whether any assembled model in the library's
examples/guides actually *includes* `Death` in a pipeline, so its intended composition partners
beyond the documented Division pairing are unverified. Verdict/contract left for the normalizer.
